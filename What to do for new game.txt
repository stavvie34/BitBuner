What ended up happening:

didn't have much money

buy hacknet node
run hacknet-test

continually ran hack-target [foodnstuff    then more servers]
on each of the beginning servers until there wasn't any more money on the server. Then I stopped and went to the next one.

trying to get enough money for 1 TB servers. 

eventually bought all 25 servers

ran all-server.script

now main-script is running on everything
----

start should be:

buy a hacknet node.
run hacknet-test

run hack-target -t max # threads [!list of 1 port servers]
	do this until the available cash = 0
		then move onto next server
			until end of server list

!now you should have enough money to do stuff

run buy-servers.script
run all-server.script

that's it
